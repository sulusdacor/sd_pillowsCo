	<description>"Of pillows and beanbags"
	Ver.: 1.0-1.0.0
	
	- could be the title of an epic tale, which might take place in your colony. or just a mod that adds  these to the game for your colonists to sit on ;)
	- stats of the pillow and beanbag are the same as the armchair
	- only exception: all pillows have reduced cover and less walking impairment, and weight a bit less
	- texture of the pillow can be switched by rotating it
